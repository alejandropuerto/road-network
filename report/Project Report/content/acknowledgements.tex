\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{cha:acknowledgments}

I would first like to thank my supervisors, Prof. Dr. Gonzalo Peraza Mues and Prof. Didier Gamboa Angulo, for their advice and guidance for the creation of this project. I wish to also express my gratitude to all the faculty members of UPY that have been involved in my professional development as Data Engineer.

In addition, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to my parents -- Miguel and Ver√≥nica -- and my family, for their unconditional love and support, and for being always there for me. Finally, I could not have completed this document without the support of my girlfriend, who provided happy distractions to rest my mind outside of my research.
