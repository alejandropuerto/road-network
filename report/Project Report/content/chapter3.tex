\chapter{Methodology and development}
\label{cha:chapter3}

\added[id=GP]{In this Chapter, I provide a description of the workflow followed during the analysis of the road network.}

\replaced{Most of the analysis}{This work} was done using Jupyter notebooks, \added{an open format which allows for documented and reproducible workflows.} \added{. All notebooks are stored in} a GitHub repository (\url{https://github.com/gperaza/road-network}\added{, private at the time of writing, since it still contains preliminary work.}). \replaced{The}{This} repository's root contains an environment definition file and a notebooks folder. Within that folder, the repository contains \added{nested subfolders, }one folder for the work done in Mérida, Yucatán, and other folder for the different cities in México, that are beyond the scope of this report. The following notebooks \added{(which included the analysis reported here)} are included in the Mérida folder:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Data preparation: downloading/modeling and calculating network stats of Mérida's road network and its urban AGEBs.
\item Analysis of the road network of Mérida and its urban AGEBs.
\item Cluster analysis of the urban AGEBs.
\end{enumerate}

To \replaced{reproduce the analysis}{run the code examples} in this resource repository, we simply \replaced{execute each notebook}{run everything} in a pre-built Anaconda environment. This process is detailed in the following section.

\section{The Environment}

\replaced{The}{This} project's repository contains an Anaconda environment file in \verb|yaml| format\deleted{(i.e., .yml)} for running the Jupyter notebooks on any computer. Anaconda \cite{anaconda} is a data science platform that facilitates package management and deployment. It is available for Windows, Linux and macOS. We use the Individual Edition, which is the open-source distribution of Anaconda.

First, download and install Anaconda Individual Edition. Once it is installed and running on your computer, run the following code in the terminal window:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda env create --file road-network-project.yml
$ conda activate road-network-project
$ jupyter lab
\end{lstlisting}

Loading the configuration file ensures all appropriate packages are loaded with the required versions. This avoids dependency problems among packages, which are hard to resolve by hand.

With the environment active, it is possible to access and edit the notebook files from the Jupyter Lab interface, which is available though a web browser at \url{http://localhost:8888}.

\section{Data Collection}

This work uses OSMnx to download the street network of Mérida and its AGEBs \added{from Open Street Map}. The road network is loaded into a graph model (using NetworkX), corrected, and analyzed. OSMnx also allows for visualization at municipal and neighborhood (AGEB) scales.

To obtain the street network, we define a function to download and save the graph of the municipality, or, if already present, load it from a previously stored NetworkX graph object:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def get_roads_osmnx(places, update=False, proj=False, crs=None):

    dirpath = pathlib.Path('./data/networks/')
    filepath = dirpath/'merida-road.graphml'
    logpath = dirpath/'log'

    if filepath.exists() and not update:
        G = ox.load_graphml(filepath)
    else:
         # get drivable public streets network,
         # aka road network, without service roads,
         # e.g. private, parking lots, etc.
         # use retain_all if you want to keep all
         # disconnected subgraphs (e.g. when your
         # places aren't adjacent)
        G = ox.graph_from_place(places, network_type='drive')
        ox.save_graphml(G, filepath=filepath, gephi=False)

    if proj:
        G = ox.project_graph(G, to_crs=crs)

    print(f"Graph created at: {G.graph['created_date']}")
    return G, *ox.graph_to_gdfs(G)

places = [{'county' : 'Merida', 'state' : 'Yucatan', 'country' : 'Mexico'}]
G_proj, nodes_proj, edges_proj = get_roads_osmnx(places, update=False,
                                                 proj=True, crs=3857)
\end{lstlisting}

OSMnx geocodes the query "Merida, Yucatan, Mexico" to retrieve the place boundaries of that city from the Nominatim API. It then retrieves the drivable street network data within those boundaries from the Overpass API and constructs a graph model (via NetworkX). OSMnx simplifies/corrects the network topology in such way that nodes represent intersections and dead-ends, and edges represent the street segments linking them. Finally, the functions saves the constructed graph as a GraphML file as to not download the same data again.

Note that the graph is projected to the WGS84 Pseudo-Mercator CRS ("EPSG:3857"). We do not use the commonly used CRS WGS84 latitude-longitude projection ("EPSG:4326"), since in such CRS the coordinates are given in degree units, and we required meters for distance calculations. For that reason, we use the "EPSG:3857" projection, where coordinates are given in meters. This last projection is the one that Google, OpenStreetMap, Bing, ArcGIS, ESRI, etc. use for rendering their maps~\cite{epsg3857}.

\comment[id=GP]{I thought we were using an UTM projection? What happened?}

Besides the graph object, the function, also returns node and edge GeoDataFrames, used for tabular storage and analysis of such entities. This is possible since OSMnx models all networks as NetworkX MultiDiGraph objects and allows conversion among different network models and data structures, i.e., from and to:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Undirected MultiGraphs.
 \item DiGraphs without (possible) parallel edges.
 \item GeoPandas node/edge GeoDataFrames.
\end{itemize}

\comment[id=GP]{If AGEBS are note previously defined we need to define them before the following paragrah. I see you defined them in a couple paragraphs below, you need to move that definition here with a short discussion of why we are using agebs.}

We collected information for Mérida's urban AGEBs from the Institute of Statistics and Geography's (INEGI) National Geoestatistical Framework (MG, by the acronym in spanish) and from socio-demographic data from INEGI's 2020 Population and Housing Census (2020 Census) conducted from March 2 to March 27, 2020~\cite{2020census}.

The MG is a mexican unique national system designed by INEGI to correctly reference statistical information from censuses and surveys with the corresponding geographic locations \cite{manualMGN}. It is conformed by geostatistical areas divided into three dissaggregation areas (see Figure \ref{fig:MGN_divisions}):

\begin{itemize}
 \item State geoestatistical areas (AGEE).
 \item Municipal geoestatistical areas (AGEM).
 \item Basic geoestatistical areas (AGEB).
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Rural AGEB.
   \item Urban AGEB.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htpb]

  \caption{MG dissaggregation areas. Retrieved from: \cite{manualMGN}.
    \label{fig:MGN_divisions}}
\end{figure}

Urban AGEBs are the geographic area, subdivision of municipal areas, occupied by a set of blocks, generally ranging from 1 to 50, perfectly delimited by streets, avenues, walkways or any other easily identifiable feature on the ground and whose land use is mainly residential, industrial, services, commercial, etc., only assigned within urban localities (see Figure \ref{fig:ageb_division}).

\begin{figure}[htpb]

  \caption{Urban AGEB dissaggregation areas. Retrieved from: \cite{manualMGN}.
    \label{fig:ageb_division}}
\end{figure}

The MG data (downloaded at~\cite{MG_data}) contains shapefiles for every dissaggregated area of every mexican state. It is made up of 32 folders, each one named by the geoestatistical key of the federal entity (from 1 to 32), with a national total of 2,469 municipal geoestatistical areas, 45,397 polygons of rural localities, and 4,911 polygons of urban localities, 295,779 points of rural localities, 350 polygons of island territory, 17,469 basic rural geostatistical areas, 63,982 basic urban geostatistical areas and 2,513,853 urban and rural blocks (including scattered hamlets). The information maintains associated names and geostatistical keys as attributes.

The MG references every dissaggregated area with a unique numeric key. The structure of such geostatistical key is represented in Figure~\ref{fig:key_structure}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/key_structure.jpg}
  \caption{MG's geostatistical key structure. Retrieved from: \cite{manualMGN}.
    \label{fig:key_structure}}
\end{figure}

Every state folder of the MG is composed of three subfolders:
\begin{itemize}
\item Catalogs (catálogos): contains the product catalogs and documentation.
\item Data set (conjunto\_de\_datos): contains 32 folders, each one corresponding to the state geoestatistical key.
\item Metadata (metadatos): contains 32 files, each one with the corresponding state geostatistical key, in xml and txt format, and a generic metadata with national information.
\end{itemize}

The file names are formed with the state geoestatistical key and the following suffixes of the file content:

Where \textbf{ee} corresponds to the state geoestatistical key (from 01 to 32).

\begin{table*}[htpb]

\end{table*}

Layers with suffix \textbf{ti}, \textbf{cd}, \textbf{pe}, \textbf{pem}, \textbf{sia}, \textbf{sil}, \textbf{sip}, are included only if the locality has this type of information.

INEGI's 2020 census data was downloaded from~\cite{2020census} as a CSV file per state with main results by AGEB and urban block (option eligible on the portal). In this work, we use only MG and census data for Yucatán (folder \verb|31_yucatan| from the MG and file \verb|31a.shp| of the basic urban geoestatistical areas).

\section{Data Exploration and Preparation}

Mérida's street network has 93485 edges and 35105 nodes, and covers a convex hull area of 1,032.4 km$^2$ that comprises the 874.4 km$^2$ of the Mérida municipality's area \cite{2020census}. However, the network is disconnected due to unfinished roads or roads at the boundary. Thus, we retain only the largest connected component (see Figure \ref{fig:merida-street-network}), which has 93371 edges and 35031 nodes, comprising the 99.9\% of edges and 99.8\% of nodes from the whole network. The covered area is the same. Figure \ref{fig:merida-street-network-boundary} shows the street network within the municipal boundary of Mérida.

\end{figure}

\replaced{As encoded by OSMnx,}{If we look at the node and edge attributes of the network, we see that} nodes are indexed by an integer value (the ID from OSM) and posses several features: $x$ and $y$ coordinates, number of streets intersecting the node (street count), type of intersection, latitude and longitude. \replaced{There are a total of}{We have} 773 nodes that are labeled by their intersection type, such as crossing, mini roundabout, motorway junction, traffic signals, turning circle, or turning loop. \deleted{Remember that nodes are considered street intersections.}

Edges (roads) and are indexed by \added(a tuple with three values): their starting and ending nodes, \replaced{and an edge key}{and a zero}. \deleted{They are tuple objects.} As mentioned, the third integer is the edge key, since in a multigraph we can have potentially more than one edge between the same pair of nodes. Each edge is identified by an integer key, and is often zero in Merida's road network, since multi edges are rare. Other edge attributes include: the ID from OSM, type of road (e.g., primary, primary link, secondary, secondary link, tertiary, tertiary link, trunk, trunk link, residential, living street, and unclassified), maximum speed, length of the road, name of the street, width, and whether it is a lane, bridge, junction, tunnel, or access road. We have 19842 lane roads, 56 bridges, 1366 road junctions, 2 tunnel roads, and 5 access roads.

One of the main objectives of the project is to analyze how street network metrics change with scale. As a first step, we imported AGEBs from the MG to create a subgraph for each different AGEB. Additionally, to include socio-demographic data in the analysis, we merged both MG and 2020 Census data, since the census dataset does not include the polygons of the AGEBs. The merging process is described in the following.

The 2020 Census data contains missing information recorded as * (asterisk) or N/D (Not Available). We replaced such values with zero (0). After,  we manually set the data types of each feature from string to the true type (float), according to~\cite{census_data}. We also dropped totals by municipality and locality as only totals by AGEB are processed in the analysis.

We create a new column in the 2020 Census dataframe to store the (full) geostatistical key, built by combining values from the geostatistical keys of state, municipality, locality, and AGEB, while omitting block information.
\comment[id=GP]{What are blocks? I think the rest of the paragraph is unecesarly descriptive. This are mostly standard preprocessing steps that, if needed, can be look up in the notebooks. Just mention you drop redundat columns and perform an inner merge.}
 We add missing zeros to the values of the municipality and locality geostatistical key to fulfill the appropiate length. Also, we change the data types of the state, municipality, and locality geostatistical keys from integer to string to concatenate them. Next, we drop columns from the 2020 Census dataframe that will be duplicated after the merging. Finally, we perform the merge with the MG dataframe on the concatenated geostatistical key column present in both dataframes using the inner merge type that uses the intersection of columns from both dataframes, similar to a SQL inner join~\cite{pandas_merge}.

The MG has geometric data from 1532 AGEBs, while the 2020 Census has data from 1432 AGEBs for Yucatán. After the merge, we ended up with the subset of 1432 AGEBs in both data sets. We further narrow the selection to include only the 523 urban AGEBs belonging to the city of Mérida. The merged geodataframe was saved as shapefiles under the name \verb|merida\_ageb\_census\_data.shp| projected in the Pseudo-Mercator CRS.

Next, we created a subgraph for each AGEB, containing only the portion of the network within each AGEB. To do this, we first created a new column with each AGEB cover area, in meters, calculated from each AGEB's polygon. The dataframe is re-project into the Mercator projection, which is the projection expected by OSMnx. Then, we create queries from the AGEBs geodataframe to automate the downloading and saving of each AGEB's road network. The queries contain the path where graphs will be saved, the polygon of the AGEB to be downloaded, and the area in meters of the AGEB. Every graph is saved in both shapefile and GraphML format. We ended up with 517 AGEBs specific graphs, because some AGEBs did not contain any node or edge within the requested polygon. The generation of the subgraphs takes around 32 minutes.

OSMnx includes two modules (basic and extended stats) for calculating geometric and topological network measures for street network analysis. The list of the measures is the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Number of nodes.
\item Number of edges.
\item Average node degree.
\item Number of intersections: nodes with $>$1 physical streets connected to them.
\item Average streets per node: how many physical streets (edges in the undirected representation of the graph) connect to each node (i.e., intersection or dead-end) on average.
\item Streets per node count: number of physical streets connecting to a node.
\item Streets per node proportion: same as previous but proportion of the total, rather than counts.
\item Total edge length: sum of all edge lengths in graph, in meters.
\item Average edge length: mean edge length in the graph, in meters.
\item Total street length: sum of all edges in the undirected representation of the graph.
\item Average street length: mean edge length in the undirected representation of the graph, in meters.
\item Street segments count: number of edges in the undirected representation of the graph.
\item Node density: number of nodes divided by area in km$^2$.
\item Intersection density: intersection count divided by area in km$^2$.
\item Edge density: Total edge length divided by area in km$^2$.
\item Street density: Total street length divided by area in km$^2$.
\item Average circuity: Total edge length divided by the sum of the great circle distances between the nodes of each edge.
\item Self-loop proportion: proportion of edges that have a single node as its endpoints (i.e., the edge links nodes u and v, and u==v).
\item Clean intersection count: number of intersections in street network, merging complex ones into single points.
\item Clean intersection density: clean intersection count divided by area in km$^2$.
\item Average neighbor degree.
\item Average neighbor degree average.
\item Average weighted neighbor degree.
\item Average weighted neighbor degree average.
\item Degree centrality.
\item Average degree centrality.
\item Clustering coefficient.
\item Average clustering coefficient.
\item Weighted clustering coefficient.
\item Average weighted clustering coefficient.
\item PageRank.
\item Maximum PageRank node.
\item Maximum Pagerank.
\item Minimum PageRank node.
\item Minimum PageRank.
\item Node connectivity.
\item Average node connectivity.
\item Edge connectivity.
\item Eccentricity.
\item Diameter.
\item Radius.
\item Center.
\item Periphery.
\item Closeness centrality.
\item Average closeness centrality.
\item Betweenness centrality.
\item Average betweenness centrality.
\end{itemize}

We calculate the listed metrics for the Mérida municipality street network, except for node and edge connectivity, eccentricity, diameter, radius, center, and periphery due to exhaustion of the computer memory. The calculations lasted around 6 hours and 7 minutes. We saved the calculations in a csv file to avoid recalculation.

For each individual subgraphs AGEBs, we do not exclude any listed metric. Such calculations lasted around 47 minutes for all AGEBs. However, two AGEBs were excluded because they had only one node. Also, when we updated the local degree, betweenness and closeness centrality to global, other two AGEBs were excluded as Mérida's street network did not include any node of such AGEBs. For such reason, we ended up working with 513 AGEBs in this work (see Figure \ref{fig:merida-ageb-street-network}). Finally, we merge the network calculations with the 2020 Census and MG data into a single geodataframe, and a column for population density was added. The data was saved in shapefiles named \textit{merida\_ageb\_stats\_census.shp}.

\section{Data Modeling}

As one of our objectives is to perform a clustering algorithm on the AGEBs to find similar AGEBs based on socio-demographic data and their network measures, we must choose how our AGEBs are going to be interconnected.

Spatial weights are used to represent geographical relationships between two spatial observations. We consider two different approaches to construct spatial weights based on contiguity/adjacency relations. Such approaches arises from the legal moves that different chess pieces can make. Rook contiguity considers two polygons as connected if they share an edge on their border (see Figure \ref{fig:rook-contiguity}). But Queen contiguity connects two polygons if they share a one or more points on their border (see Figure \ref{fig:queen-contiguity}). As result, queen representation has more neighbors than rook has. We chose a rook representation as it exploits the sparse nature of contiguity weights matrices \cite{rey_geo_ds_2020}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/rook-contiguity.jpg}
  \caption{Rook contiguity.
    \label{fig:rook-contiguity}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/queen-contiguity.jpg}
  \caption{Queen contiguity.
    \label{fig:queen-contiguity}}
\end{figure}

When we construct the rook adjacency matrix, we had to eliminate some AGEBs that were disconnected (islands). We drop AGEBs from Mérida localities such as San José Tzal, Komchen, Chablekal, as well as the Military Base and the Airport of Mérida. The adjacency matrix is used to add connectivity constraints to the clustering algorithm to impose a certain structure defining for each sample the neighboring samples. Also, it makes the algorithm faster.

The clustering algorithm that we use in this work is the hierarchical clustering (also known as connectivity-based clustering) that builds nested clusters by merging or splitting them recursively. The hierarchy of clusters is represented as a tree (or dendrogram). A machine learning Python library, called Scikit-Learn \cite{scikit-learn}, provides us their implementation of the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm.

The agglomerative clustering is the most common type of hierarchical clustering used to group objects in clusters based on their similarity. It uses a bottom-up approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, then pairs of clusters are successively merged until all clusters have been merged together \cite{hierarchical_scikit}. The linkage criteria determines the metric used for the merge strategy:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ward} minimizes the variance of the clusters being merged.
\item \textbf{Maximum} or \textbf{complete linkage} minimizes the maximum distance between observations of pairs of clusters.
\item \textbf{Average linkage} minimizes the average of the distances between all observations of pairs of clusters.
\item \textbf{Single linkage} minimizes the distance between the closest observations of pairs of clusters.
\end{itemize}

We select ward linkage as the most suitable because we only have an adjacency matrix, not a distance matrix.

The final step was to find the appropiate number of clusters for the algorithm. Based on empirical observation, 14 clusters were selected as they best describe similarity between AGEBs.
